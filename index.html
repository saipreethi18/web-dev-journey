        <p>Hi, I'm Sai Preethi Kota â€” a self-driven and curious developer passionate about building real-world projects using technologies like React, Python, and automation tools.
        I enjoy learning by doing, especially when it comes to web development, APIs, and integrating AI into practical tools. 
        I'm currently exploring how to use LLMs like ChatGPT in backend workflows and looking to gain more experience by working on startup-style projects that blend frontend, backend, and automation.
         </p>
